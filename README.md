# DeepLab's purpose

DeepLab is a free open software characterized by a front-end written in java code and a back-end written in C. the objectives it aims to achieve relate to all that cocern the deepLearning and neural networks, including different techniques of supervised learning unsupervised learning and deep reinforcment learning.


DeepLab will try to provide adequate support through a graphical interface for the implementation of neural networks to be used for the various learning techniques.


among the objectives it aims to achieve, the main ones concern the implementation of:


MLP networks

Convolutional networks

Residual networks

Recurrent networks

Networking encoders

Capsule networks

Recursive networks

Local normalization

Batch normalization

L1 regularization

L2 regularization

Dropout

Augmentation data
