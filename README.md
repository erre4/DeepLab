# DeepLab

DeepLab is a free open software characterized by a front-end written in Java code and a back-end written in C. the objectives it aims to achieve relate to all that cocern the DeepLearning and Neural Networks, including different techniques of Supervised learning Unsupervised learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning.


DeepLab will try to provide adequate support through a graphical interface for the implementation of neural networks to be used for the various learning techniques.


Among the objectives it aims to achieve, the main ones concern the implementation of:


- MLP networks

- Convolutional networks

- Residual networks

- Recurrent networks

- Networking encoders

- Capsule networks

- Recursive networks

- Local normalization

- Batch normalization

- L1 regularization

- L2 regularization

- Dropout

- Augmentation data

- DQN

- DDQN

- Genetic algorithm

- DRL related to currently published papers

- Neural structures like ImageNet AlexNet

- ...

- Sigmoid function

- Tanh function

- Softmax function

- Relu function

- ...

- MSE

- Cross-Entropy

- likelihood

- ...

- Gradient Descent

- Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Momentum

- Newton's method

- Adam optimization algorithm

- ...



- and more.

# Running Mode

DeepLab will run on both the CPU and the GPU, on the latter through its implementation in OpenCl and in the future perhaps also in Cuda. For the compilation of the code, a cointainer with OpenCl will probably be provided
